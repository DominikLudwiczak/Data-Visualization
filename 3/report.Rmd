# Executive summary

The analyses of the Rebrickable dataset can provide many valuable insights. Our project focused on:

* discovering most used bricks and which category they belong to
* finding most popular colors used in different lego sets and what is their theme
* checking if there are bricks that are not beeing as used as they could have been
* tracking how most popular themes changed by years
* testing variances of numbers of elements used in lego sets throught decades

Overall, these analyses provide useful insights into the LEGO building system, which can be valuable for LEGO enthusiasts, designers, and educators. But above all, they provide interesting information for the curious.

# Usage of top 10 most popular parts
```{r viz1, echo=F}

```

This graph shows the usage of the top 10 most popular LEGO parts, based on the inventory_parts data. The bars are colored by category which they belong to, and the height of each bar represents the usage of the corresponding part. One more interesting example is 30° slope which turned out to be more popular then expected.

This graph displays the number of distinct colors used in the top 10 sets, based on the inventory_parts and inventories data. Each bar represents a set and is colored according to the set's theme. The height of the bar represents the number of distinct colors used in the set, and the label on the y-axis shows the set name and version.

# Alternate and usage of parts
```{r viz3, echo=F}
p3
```

The graph shows the relationship between the usage of LEGO parts and their number of alternatives. The x-axis represents the usage of a part, while the y-axis shows how many other parts can be used as an alternative to that part. The color of the dots represents the material of the part. The graph aims to identify the parts that are used the most and have fewer alternatives, indicating their importance and necessity in building LEGO sets. The graph also helps in identifying the parts that can be replaced with other alternatives to save costs.

# Rank of theme's popularity between 2008 and 2023
```{r viz4, echo=F}
p4
```

This graph shows the rank of the popularity of different Lego themes between 2008 and 2023. Each point on the graph represents the rank of a theme in a particular year, with the y-axis representing the rank and the x-axis representing the year. The colors of the points and lines represent different themes. The graph shows the top three most popular themes each year.

# Variability of number of parts among decades
```{r viz5, echo=F}
p5
```

This graph shows the variability of the number of parts in LEGO sets across decades. The x-axis represents the decade in which the sets were released and the y-axis shows the number of parts in each set. The graph uses boxplots to visualize the distribution of the number of parts for each decade, with the height of the box representing the interquartile range (IQR) and the whiskers indicating the range of the data. The graph suggests that the maximum number of parts in LEGO sets has been increasing over the decades, however median and lowest values stay relatively similar.

# Distribution of Number of Parts by Decade
```{r viz6, echo=F}
p6
```

This graph shows the distribution of the number of parts in Lego sets over different decades. The data is summarized using the 25th, 50th (median), 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of the number of parts for each decade. The graph displays each percentile as an area chart, with each color representing a different percentile. The lines in the same colors show the trend of each percentile over time. The x-axis represents decades, and the y-axis represents the number of parts. Graph shows that 25th and 50th percentile stay pretty much same throught years however largest sets get even larger containing more and more pieces.
